## Polypharmacy Side-Effects Risk Predictor 
Polypharmacy Side Effects Risk Predictor Using Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning
A quantum-enhanced predictive system designed to identify adverse drug interactions in patients taking multiple medications, improving clinical decision-making and patient safety.

## About
The Polypharmacy Side Effects Risk Predictor is an innovative healthcare AI system that leverages hybrid quantum-classical machine learning to predict potential adverse effects from drug combinations. Traditional pharmacovigilance methods struggle with the exponential complexity of multi-drug interactions and limited clinical data. This project addresses these challenges by implementing quantum machine learning algorithms that can process high-dimensional pharmacological data more efficiently than classical approaches. The system analyzes molecular structures, drug-target interactions, and clinical profiles to provide real-time risk assessments, empowering healthcare professionals to make safer prescription decisions and prevent harmful drug interactions.

## Results and Impact
The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid quantum–classical model achieves performance comparable to classical baselines, validating the feasibility of applying quantum machine learning to drug–drug interaction risk prediction. Although predictive accuracy remains modest, the system successfully models complex molecular relationships using variational quantum circuits.

This project highlights the potential of hybrid quantum machine learning in computational pharmacology and provides a foundation for future exploration involving deeper quantum circuits, advanced feature encoding strategies, and real quantum hardware execution.
